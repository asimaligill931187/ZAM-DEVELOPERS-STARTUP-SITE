            <h3 class=" privicy-subheading">How we use cookies and other tracking technology to collect information </h3>
            <p class="text-center-justify-allignment">
                "Cookies" are special identification numbers that we download to your browser or device so that we can identify it when you visit again and track how and when you use different parts of our website. We track your preferences and repeat visits using cookies and related technologies. We also use traffic analysis and campaign effectiveness measurements. We may continue to gather information about your online activities even after you leave our Services, either through our browser extension or cookies we put on your device or browser. This information helps us to enhance the Services, personalize your online experience, and do other things as outlined in this Privacy Policy, just like any other usage data we gather.<br>
                Most browsers have a Help feature that can tell you how to disable cookies completely, have your browser alert you when a new cookie arrives, or stop it from accepting new ones. Additionally, by adjusting the add-ons settings or going to the manufacturer's website, you can disable or remove similar data used by browser add-ons, like Flash cookies. We advise you to leave cookies enabled since they let you use some of our most important features.<br>

            <h3 class=" privicy-subheading">Google Analytical </h3>
            <p class="text-center-justify-allignment">
                Like the majority of websites, Zam Developers collects certain information automatically through third-party tracking services and saves it in log files. The internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, operating system, referring/exit pages, internet service provider (ISP), datetime stamp, and clickstream data are among the details included in this data.<br>
                We use this non-personally identifiable information to track users' movements around the site, analyze trends, administer the site, and compile demographic data about our user base as a whole.
            </p>
            <h3 class=" privicy-subheading">Log Files </h3>
            <p class="text-center-justify-allignment">
                A program known as "Google Analytics" is used by this website to gather data regarding site usage. Google Analytics gathers data about users' visits to this website, the pages they view when they do so, and the websites they visited before arriving here. We only utilize the data we receive from Google Analytics to make this website better. Your name or any other identifying information is not collected by Google Analytics; only the IP address that was assigned to you on the day that you visited this website is. Information gathered via Google Analytics is not combined with personally identifiable information by us. Google Analytics sets a persistent cookie on your browser, but only Google can use it to recognize you as an individual the next time you visit this website. The Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy limit how Google can use and share the data it collects about your visits to this website. You can disable cookies on your browser to stop Google Analytics from recognizing you when you return to this website.

            <h3 class=" privicy-subheading">Keeping your information safe</h3>
            <p class="text-center-justify-allignment">
                We take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all the data we collect through our service, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. We are concerned about the security of your information. We cannot, however, ensure that our systems are 100% secure because no security system is impenetrable. If a security breach results in the compromise of any information under our control, we will investigate the situation as soon as possible, notify the individuals whose information may have been compromised, and take further action in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.

                <li><strong>Right to restriction.</strong> The right to obtain the restriction of the processing undertaken by us on your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of that personal data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to portability.</strong> The right to portability allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one organization to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object.</strong> You have a right to object to processing based on legitimate interests and direct marketing.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class=" privicy-subheading">International Users outside of the United Kingdom, European Union, and Switzerland</h3>
            <p class="text-center-justify-allignment">
                You acknowledge and agree that your continued use of the Services, which is governed by US law and this policy, will result in the transfer of your personal information into the US, if you are receiving Services from the EU, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data that differ from US laws. Any nation in which we operate facilities or where we work with outside service providers to provide services may be the location where your data is processed and stored. You agree to the transfer of information to nations outside of your home country—which might have different data protection laws than your own—by using our services. <br>
                Although this information is located outside of your country, it is still governed by the laws of the nation in which it is held. Additionally, the laws of that nation may require that this information be disclosed to its governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies.<br>
                Even though users from the EU, UK, and Switzerland have more comprehensive rights to access and delete their data than you do, you can still make a privacy request, and we will try our best to abide by it as long as it's not more severe than the GDPR's permitted uses of data.
